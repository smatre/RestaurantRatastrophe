// Restaurant Ratastrophe
// By:
// Sonia Atre 
// Brian Zhang 
// Fernanda Becerra
// Date Completed: 5/3/2021
// Creative Tilt Justification:
// technically interesting: 
// 1. added increasing difficulty of mouse trap. 
// We decremented the delay each time so the mouse traps get 
// closer and closer every scene (minimum delay: 1.5 seconds)
// 2. added a tint on the rat for power-up (eating the cheese), and 
// set a timer for the tint to last 30 seconds (same duration as the powerup)

//visually style: 1. We are very proud of our music, 
// the sound effects and music fit really well with our happy and playful
// theme. We also had no prior experience with sound, 
// so we believe we did really well despite that
//2. We are very proud of our artwork. It fits in really well with our theme,
// and the cartoonish look was exactly what we were going for
